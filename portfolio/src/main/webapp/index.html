            <p class="first-paragraph">
                I am a first generation college student, in my second year studying Computer Science and Internet
                Studies. I am
                currently based in Seattle, WA, and attend college in Bellingham!
            </p>
            <p>
                At my institution, Western Washington University, I am engaged in research specializing in digital
                privacy and
                its
                portrayal in the media. My work is aimed at creating a digital web game to engage students of all ages
                and teach
                the importance of digital privacy and how we go about advocating for those impacted by breaches in that
                privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of my favorite activities include playing piano and cello in my free time, reading, drawing, and
                designing
                digital web pages! I first fell in love with computer science through learning HTML and enjoy
                incorporating that
                love in my research and studies!
            </p>
            <p>
                Growing up, I often visited my mother's hometown of Chiclayo, Peru and consider it my second home. I
                have
                always
                grown up with a love of culture and hope to one day explore other cultures to broaden my world-view!
